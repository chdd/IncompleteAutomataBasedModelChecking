The *CHIAAutomata* module contains the classes which are used to manage *BAs* and *IBAs*. 

These two classes describe BAs and IBAs using an explicit representation of the state space, which is build upon the JGraphT library. 

The class diagram of the CHIAAutomata module is represented in Figure~\ref{Fig:CHIAAutomataClass} and is hereafter discussed:
