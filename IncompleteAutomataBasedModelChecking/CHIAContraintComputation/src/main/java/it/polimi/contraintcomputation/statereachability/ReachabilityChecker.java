/**
 * ReachabilityChecker is the checker which allows to compute a data structure
 * which can then answer reachability queries on any pair of vertices in as low
 * as O(1) time. The reachabilty checker exploits the The Floydâ€“Warshall
 * algorithm which computes the transitive closure of any directed graph, which
 * gives rise to the reachability relation as in the definition, above. The
 * algorithm requires O(|V|^3) time and O(|V|^2) space in the worst case.
