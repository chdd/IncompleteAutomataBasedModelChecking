<!-- In the state After retracting the crane is initialized. The crane is 
	initialized as follows: first the lifting_cylinder is extended (transition 
	8), then when the input signal that specifies that the crane has been extended 
	arrives (transition 9), the system moves into the releasing state. In the 
	releasing state the system releases the crane (transition 10). When the input 
	signals that specifies that the crane has been released arrives, the system 
	moves into the state released (transition 9). The state 9 is left through the port 10, labeled as statkinitialized-->
