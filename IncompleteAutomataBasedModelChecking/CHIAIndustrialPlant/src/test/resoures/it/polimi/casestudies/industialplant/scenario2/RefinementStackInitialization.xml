<!-- This component contains the refinement of the transparent state of the 
	model BeforeRetracting. The developer specifies that the system may be in 
	two transparent states: BeforeReleasing and AfterReleasing the system moves 
	from the state BeforeRetracting to the state AfterReleasing when the actretract 
	action arrives. The state BeforeReleasing is the initial state of the refinement 
	which is reached by the incoming ports 9 which arrives from the source state 
	1 and is labeled with the proposition distart. The state AfterReleasing is 
	the final state of the system which is left by the port 26 which goes to 
	the state of the model 2 and is labeled with the proposition actreleased -->
